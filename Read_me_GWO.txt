1_ import libraries
2_ if you want make sure the code works fine, check the parameters in the article
3_ update the location of your datasets from line 58 to 61 (the main images are documented)
4_ the GWO algorithm starts from line 195
P.S. you can measure the time of the algorithm by adding the time library and you can do some visualizations with pandas (but i didn't do that :) )
